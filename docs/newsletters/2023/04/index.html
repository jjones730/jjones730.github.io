            <p>
                Austin's market is trending towards a sweet spot, inventory is up, and prices are restabilizing after coming off two unprecedented years. 
            </p>            
            <p>
                Home sales have declined year-over-year and it is taking a longer time on average to sell a home compared to last year. Buyers continue to gain more options and negotiation power, while sellers have more time to make their next move. 
            </p>

            <p>
                It is critical for you to work with a local REALTOR® who can provide a detailed analysis of market trends in your specific neighborhood and walk through all available options for you to buy or sell with confidence.

          <h2>AUSTIN, Home Sweet Home!</h2>
          <p>
            My husband and I moved to Austin as newlyweds almost twenty years ago. At first, it was to try it out for two years, but we quickly fell in love with beautiful Austin. The rest is history!
          </p>
          <p>
            Austin is the city I've lived in for the longest time in my entire life, and the city where I raised my two sons.  It is crazy how much and how quickly this city has grown right in front of my eyes. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd love to share everything I know and love about this city and help you find your dream home: whether it is your first, second, third,  or fourth here in Austin! We can meet over a cup of coffee, a nice walk or happy hour. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Call or text me at 512.963.6887.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sincerely,    
          </p>
